INTRODUCTION
=============
This is a list of ideas that i'm building up to allow any developers or investor to pick up the idea and create solution to it.
It is an open idea space world. A lot of people might be kicking against this asking why didn't I make a living from it.

The truth is, we don't have much time here on earth. Great men like Mandela, Steve Job have all passed away but left a significant amount of influence in our lives because of their idealogy about life. So why waste ideas when someone can pick an item in the list and create something beautiful out of it.

<ol>
	<li>Web Based Solutions</li>
